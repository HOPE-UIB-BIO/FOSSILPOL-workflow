<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the **FOSSILPOL workflow** is to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardized dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses. The FOSSILPOL workflow is coded as an RStudio project (in the R environment), which should be customised by the user for a specific research project.
